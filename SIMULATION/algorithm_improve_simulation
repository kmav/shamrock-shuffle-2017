ask for runners every 5k
figure out where I am off in each segment
get runners at time=t-10
    increase/decrease their speed by some arbitrary amount
        fire them away for 10 minutes
        see if WRONG decreases
        while it decreases (no more than 5 times)
            increase/decrease their speed by 1%
            calculate the difference
        
        when done 
            move people as you see fit to adjust for the 5k data
