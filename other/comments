at 11:45 in real time: we have 20,000 people passed 10k

in 2014, at 11:40 we had 20,000 people passed 10k

so set offset to -5
    from now on, display the 2014 number from t-5 minutes
    

*assuming everyone runs at the same pace


/// get:
    at any time, number of people within a mile marker
    
    
    
    then
    at any time, number of people that have passed each 5k mark (to compare later with real-time data)

Density
    - Have simulation based on temperature
        - maybe extract from database:
            database: 
                have table:
                    - minute
                    - density (temp) at different points
                    - offset for each 
                    
    -or 
        database: has all the inputs 
        have also formulas for each 
        
        get: 
            5k segments expected with the 

***
    store in a table the stuff we need (distributions, slopes) ? (maybe vars in javascript)
    Every time we get an input:
        get minute of the race
        calculate all runners and where they are based on temperature and corral
        get some measure of density per mile 
        extract from database (offsets) the offset for the last number 
        modify density based off this offset 
            those who were in an interval [5k] where offset is <0, slow down 
            those who were in an interval [5k] where offset is >0, speed up 
        
        calculate the 5k interval approximation
        
        read inputs of 5k intervals from file or terminal or something 
        figure out what groups are slow and what groups are fast

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the simulation - improve maybe on corrals and other stuff to make simulation better

    + generate every minute 
    + Runner has:
        corral
        speed 
        stdDev
        slope 
        position 
        
    Option
        decrease 1 minute / increase 1 minute (or 2,3,5,10)
            modify simulation by that 1 minute
        Input new data for 5k
            Ask user for data from runners for every 5k 
            Ask for confirmation
            Perform modification to the simulation as follows:
                calculate how many are in each segment in the simulation
                calculate how many are in each segment in real-time
                
                for every consecutive segment pair
                    calculate the discrepancy
                    put the discrepancy at the line between segments
                        assign the closest runners on the side of the discrepancy to the corresponding position multiple of 5k  
                        let them run again
            
            store that simulation
            store new data of each runner 
            
            create density graph to display on map? 
                --this could also happen with a refresh or every minute?
        quit 
        
        RUN THE MODEL
            simulateDensity.py
                ARGUMENTS:
                    minute of the race at which the simulation begins
                    
            will retrieve the status of the race as of the minute mentioned
                directly from the database
