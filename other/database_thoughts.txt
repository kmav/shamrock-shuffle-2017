THOUGHTS ON DATABASE


1. Need to output csv files from the database
2. Need to be able to input into the database


** All php database queries / or python will retrieve directly from the LAST element in the database
UNLESS DOING TIME SERIES STUFF - not yet

DASHBOARD - only display information directly from .csv files

CHANGE_INFO
    MEDICAL
        Has a box for each field and you can update by clicking up/down or writing the number
        Retrieves directly from database
        You can change through javascript to add/delete things
        
        Click 'update' will immediately change db information by ADDING new field
        
    RUNNERS
        Same as the medical website. asks info and saves on database
        
        
        
        
        
** SEE IF CAN WRITE TO FILE, OTHERWISE, USE PYTHON FOR NOW
